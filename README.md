##Alternate States Aware Listbox for Qlik Sense
### Description
This extension is a simple listbox with additional custom configuration option 'State'. The user can assign an alternate state to the listbox object.

To add or remove alternate states to a Qlik Sense application you can use my [Alternate States](https://github.com/simeonsv/sense-alternate-states) extension.
### Compatibility
This extension should work on Qlik Sense version 1.1 and newer, although I have only tested it on 2.1.1.
