##Alternate States Aware Listbox for Qlik Sense
### Description
This extension is a simple listbox with additional custom configuration option 'State'. The user can assign an alternate state to the listbox object.

![AlternateStatesAwareListbox](https://github.com/simeonsv/sense-alternate-states-listbox/blob/master/img/alt-states-listbox-prop.png)

To add or remove alternate states to a Qlik Sense application you can use my [Alternate States](https://github.com/simeonsv/sense-alternate-states) extension.
### Compatibility
This extension should work on Qlik Sense version 1.1 and newer, although I have only tested it on 2.1.1.

### Known Limitations
* Supports only up to 50 values in the linked dimension.
* No search in through the values of the linked dimension.
* Doesn't transform in a dropdown box when screen space is limited.

### Future Development
As of January 2016 this project is marked as CLOSED and no further development is planned.
